Where are you, Varvara?

How sad and banal it turned out,
You left me and I scream with tears in my eyes
in the middle of the night.
I am very upset and I feel the solitude is
approaching me.
I am scared and I am not sure I will survive.

Varvara (x2)

How sad and banal it turned out,
You left me and I scream with tears in my eyes
in the middle of the night.
I am very upset and I feel the solitude is
approaching me.
I am scared and I am not sure I will survive.

I was ready to go to the ends of the Earth with you,
But you betrayed me and ran away
You broke the bonds and now it's over for me
I have no joy, that's the story.

Varvara (x4)
.
Once I was happy
But happiness vanished.
Sorrow replaced it and took over my life.
And it's useless to wait for you by the door,
Oh you are so far away from me
