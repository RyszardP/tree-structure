She is made from air and ice
You hardly could touch her.
Her crystal eyes
Didn't reflect me.

Parting is like wall that reaches the stars.
Let fly with me.

Chorus:
If your angels would leave me
In place where thin thread is kept in silent emptiness.
If angels could tell me someday.
You can call thousand of moons, I'll be waiting

Easy way to foreign heaven.
It seems that pages of days are turned over.
And foot print was lost on sand
And an ice was melted near to heart

Parting is like wall that reaches the stars.
Let fly with me.
