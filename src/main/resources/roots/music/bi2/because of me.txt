Because of me - nights without fire and aim
Because of me - on the eve
Because of me - really stopped
Because of me - line of fire.

There is no cure to get warmer, if your heart suddenly stops,
There is no cure against death
In this world
There is no cure to get back, if you can't wake up,
There is no cure against death
Unlike the wind...

Because of me - only the day before
Because of me - night without lights
Because of me - maybe I'm dead
It this times on the eve...

There is no cure to get warmer, if your heart suddenly stops,
There is no cure against death
In this world
There is no cure to get back, if you can't wake up,
There is no cure against death
Unlike the wind...
