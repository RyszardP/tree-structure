In days, when all earthly impressions
Where utter novelty for me –
And looks of maids and noise of groves,
And nightingale’s                   plea, –
When highly elevated senses,
The love, the liberty, the pride
And arts’                      fancies
Such strongly aggravated blood –
Having filled time of bliss and hopes
With sudden bitterness of pine,
Some genius of the evil scopes
Began invade a realm of mine.
Our meetings were all sad and secret, dismel
His smile and ever charming look,
His speeches’ endless evil ringlet,
Poured poison in my soul’s brook.
